### **Reflection**  

**Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template**  
Selecting the right GitHub template was challenging because each template has different strengths and limitations. For example, the Basic Kanban template is straightforward but lacks automation, whereas the Automated Kanban template offers useful automation features like auto-moving issues, but it required more time to configure correctly. Customizing the board also presented challenges in balancing simplicity with functionality. Adding new columns like Testing and Blocked was necessary for better tracking, but it made the board more complex. Finding the right work-in-progress (WIP) limits was also difficult because setting them too low could cause delays, while setting them too high could lead to overload and loss of focus.  


**Comparison with Other Tools**  
Compared to other tools like Trello and Jira, GitHubâ€™s templates have both advantages and limitations:  

| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Customization Level | Integration with Code |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **GitHub** | Direct integration with code repositories; automated tracking and linking to issues | Fewer built-in reporting features | High | Strong |
| **Trello** | Simple, user-friendly interface; drag-and-drop cards | Limited automation; weak integration with development workflows | Medium | Weak |
| **Jira** | Advanced reporting and sprint management; powerful for large projects | Steeper learning curve; complex setup | High | Strong |

- **GitHub** stood out because it integrates directly with the repository, making it easy to track development progress without switching between tools.  
- **Trello** is simple and easy to use but lacks deeper automation and integration with coding workflows.  
- **Jira** is more powerful for complex projects but can be overwhelming for smaller teams or simpler projects.  



**Conclusion**  
GitHub Projects was the best choice for this project because of its direct integration with GitHub Issues and its ability to automate status updates and track code changes. Despite some initial setup challenges, the final customized Kanban board improved task visibility, supported Agile principles, and ensured that the development process remained organized and transparent.
