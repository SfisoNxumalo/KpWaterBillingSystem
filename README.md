# KP Water Billing System

## Introduction
The **KP Water Billing System** is a digital solution designed to replace the manual, paper-based water meter reading and billing process in our community. Currently, employees record water readings on paper, manually generate bills, and send them to customers. 

## Solution
The **KP Water Billing System** provides a streamlined digital approach:
- Employees enter readings using a **mobile app**.
- A **photo of the meter reading** is captured as proof.
- The system automatically stores the data in a **cloud database**.
- Bills are generated **at the end of the month** and sent to customers via **email**.
- Customers can view their **billing history and usage reports** through a web dashboard.
