# Branch Protection Rules

To maintain code quality and prevent accidental changes to production code, we enforce the following protection rules on the `main` branch:

- **Pull Request Reviews Required:** All changes must go through peer review before being merged.
- **Status Checks Required:** CI tests must pass before merging to ensure no breaking changes are introduced.
- **No Direct Pushes:** Prevents bypassing CI/CD and review workflows, which improves stability and accountability.
