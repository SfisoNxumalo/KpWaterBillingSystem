Participating in the peer review and open-source contribution exercise for the KP Water Billing System was both exciting and enlightening. I shared my GitHub repository link with my classmates via our WhatsApp group, and the response was incredibly encouraging. As of now, the repository has received 46 stars and 38 forks. This level of engagement helped validate the time and effort I invested into making the project accessible and collaborative. However, it also came with challenges and valuable lessons.

1. Improving the Repository Based on Peer Feedback
After sharing my project, I received a variety of constructive feedback from my peers. Many appreciated the modularity of the code and the use of generics in the repository pattern to reduce duplication across entities. However, several classmates pointed out areas where documentation could be improved for newcomers. Based on this, I expanded the README.md file to include a "Getting Started" section with step-by-step setup instructions.The CONTRIBUTING.md file guides new contributors on how to fork, create branches, write tests, and open pull requests. This made the repository feel more welcoming and structured.

Another improvement I made was labeling beginner-friendly issues. I tagged 5+ issues as good-first-issue and 3+ as feature-request. This helped contributors quickly identify what they could work on. One suggestion was to add comments inside complex classes like the factory and service layers. So, I added inline comments and summaries to improve code readability.

2. Challenges in Onboarding Contributors
One major challenge I faced was the language barrier. Since the project is built with C#, a language not all of my peers are familiar with, several students expressed that they struggled to contribute. While the concepts were understandable, the syntax and .NET structure were new to many. I had to explain how to set up a C# development environment and sometimes guide contributors step-by-step through using Visual Studio or running tests with dotnet test.

Another recurring issue was that people would lose the repository link in the WhatsApp chat. I found myself reposting it multiple times to ensure everyone had access. In future collaborative settings, I would consider using a pinned post or shared document for easy access to essential links.

3. Lessons Learned
This assignment taught me a lot about open-source collaboration. First, I learned that documentation is just as important as code. Without proper onboarding materials, even the most well-written codebase can feel intimidating. Second, I realized that creating space for contributors means going beyond just sharing a repo — it means providing context, mentorship, and encouragement.

I also learned the importance of maintaining a consistent and clear structure. By enforcing contribution guidelines and labeling issues, the project felt more professional and contributor-friendly. Most importantly, I learned that collaboration takes patience. Not everyone moves at the same pace, and as the project owner, it’s important to support others as they learn.

Overall, this experience has deepened my understanding of what it means to build not just a project, but a community around it.
