# KP Water Billing System

## Introduction
The **KP Water Billing System** is a digital solution designed to replace the manual, paper-based water meter reading and billing process in our community. Currently, employees record water readings on paper, manually generate bills, and send them to customers. This approach is inefficient, prone to human errors, and lacks proof of recorded readings. The KP Water Billing System automates and streamlines this process, making it more accurate and efficient.

## Problem Statement
In many communities, water meter readings are recorded manually, leading to inefficiencies such as:
1. **Human Errors**: Mistakes in manual data entry result in inaccurate billing.
2. **Lack of Verification**: No proof exists for recorded readings, leading to potential disputes.
3. **Time-Consuming Process**: Manually generating and distributing bills delays payments.
4. **Data Loss Risks**: Paper records are susceptible to damage and loss.


## Features
- **Mobile App for Employees**: Employees will use a mobile app to enter water readings for each household.
- **Photo Capture for Proof**: A picture of the meter reading will be taken and stored for verification.
- **Cloud-based Backend**: Data is uploaded and stored in a secure centralized database.
- **Automated Billing System**: Monthly water bills will be generated automatically based on recorded readings.
- **Email Notifications**: Customers will receive their bills via email.
- **User Dashboard**: Customers can access their billing history and usage reports.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Flutter (for mobile app)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / Firebase
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 for storing meter reading images
- **Email Service**: AWS SES / SendGrid for email notifications
