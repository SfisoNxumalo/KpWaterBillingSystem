### **Reflection on Challenges in Prioritization, Estimation, and Stakeholder Alignment**  

#### **Introduction**  
Working on the KP Water Billing System using Agile methods came with several challenges, especially since I acted as both the product owner and the main stakeholder. The main difficulties involved deciding which features were most important, estimating how much time and effort tasks would take, and staying focused on delivering a working product instead of trying to include every possible feature at once.

### **1. Challenges in Prioritization**  
The first challenge was deciding which features were most important for the system to function properly. In the MoSCoW method, I had to decide which features were "Must-Haves" and which could be added later.  

- Recording water readings and generating bills were clearly essential, so they had to be prioritized as "Must-Haves."  
- Features like uploading a photo of the reading and viewing a dashboard were useful but not necessary for the system to work, so they were listed as "Should-Haves" or "Could-Haves."  

It was difficult to avoid the temptation of adding too many features at once. However, I realized that focusing on delivering a basic working version (MVP) was more important than building a complex system right away.

### **2. Challenges in Effort Estimation**  
Estimating how long each task would take was another challenge. Since I was working alone, it was hard to predict the effort required, especially for complex tasks like generating bills or handling data uploads.  

- Simple tasks like creating an input form were easy to estimate.  
- More complex tasks, like developing the billing logic, were harder to estimate because they involved testing and potential bugs.  

To manage this, I used story points instead of time estimates. Simple tasks got lower points, while complex ones got higher points. This allowed me to adjust the workload during the sprint without overloading myself.

### **3. Challenges in Aligning with Stakeholder Needs**  
Since I was the only stakeholder, the challenge was deciding which features would deliver the most value. It was tempting to add extra features to make the app more advanced, but that would have delayed the MVP.  

- The main goal was to create a system that allows employees to record readings, store data, and generate bills automatically.  
- Extra features like data visualizations and advanced user controls were useful but not necessary for the first version.  

By focusing on the core goal, I managed to keep the scope under control and avoid wasting time on non-essential features.

### **4. Lessons Learned and Adjustments**  
Through this process, I learned that:  
- It’s important to focus on the core features that deliver the most value.  
- Estimating effort based on complexity rather than time helps with planning.  
- Keeping the scope simple and manageable leads to faster delivery.  
- Agile development allows for future improvements after the MVP is released.  

Going forward, I will focus on delivering a working version first, then improve the system based on user feedback. Keeping the backlog well-organized and realistic will help avoid overloading future sprints.

### **Conclusion**  
The biggest challenge was balancing the need to build a complete system with the reality of limited time and resources. By focusing on core functionality, estimating effort realistically, and avoiding feature creep, I created a manageable plan for delivering a functional system. Agile development taught me that it’s better to deliver a simple working product quickly and improve it over time rather than aim for perfection from the start.
