### **Template Analysis and Selection**  

| Template Name | Columns and Workflows | Automation Features | Suitability for Agile Methodologies | Justification |  
|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------|  
| **Basic Kanban** | "To Do," "In Progress," "Done" | No automation | Simple workflow, easy to set up and use | Suitable for small projects, but lacks automation for sprint tracking |  
| **Automated Kanban** | "To Do," "In Progress," "Done" | Automatically moves issues based on status updates | Supports sprint tracking and status updates without manual intervention | Ideal for Agile sprints due to automation and clear tracking |  
| **Bug Triage** | "New," "Triage," "In Progress," "Done" | Auto-moves issues based on labels and assignments | Designed for handling bug reports and feature requests | More suited for maintenance rather than new feature development |  

**Chosen Template: Automated Kanban**  
The Automated Kanban template is the best fit for the KP Water Billing System because it supports Agile development by automatically updating the board as issues are updated. This reduces the need for manual tracking and ensures real-time visibility into sprint progress. The "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" structure aligns well with Agile sprint cycles, helping the team track and complete tasks efficiently.
