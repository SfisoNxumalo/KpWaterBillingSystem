### **Kanban Board Explanation**  

A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage and track tasks through different stages of a workflow. It helps teams organize their work, monitor progress, and identify bottlenecks. The board is divided into columns that represent the different phases of task completion (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Testing, Done). Tasks are represented by cards that move from one column to another as they progress through the workflow.  


### **How My Kanban Board Works**  

1. **Visualizes Workflow**  
   - The board includes the following columns:  
     - **To Do** – Tasks that need to be completed.  
     - **In Progress** – Tasks that are currently being worked on.  
     - **Testing** – Tasks under quality review.  
     - **Blocked** – Tasks that cannot proceed due to external issues.  
     - **Done** – Completed tasks.  
   - This setup allows the team to see the status of each task at a glance, helping identify where attention is needed.  


2. **Limits Work-In-Progress (WIP)**  
   - To avoid overloading team members and causing delays, I have set WIP limits:  
     - **In Progress** column → Maximum of 3 tasks at a time  
     - **Testing** column → Maximum of 2 tasks at a time  
   - Limiting WIP ensures that the team stays focused on completing tasks rather than starting too many at once.  



3. **Supports Agile Principles**  
   - **Continuous Delivery** – The board enables tracking of tasks through all phases, allowing quick delivery of completed work.  
   - **Adaptability** – If priorities change or issues arise, tasks can be easily reorganized within the board.  
   - **Transparency** – All team members can see the status of each task, ensuring alignment and accountability.  
   - **Collaboration** – Tasks are assigned to specific team members, and labels like `bug` and `feature` help clarify the type of work involved.  



### **Summary**  
The Kanban board helps streamline the development process by making the workflow visible, controlling workload with WIP limits, and supporting Agile principles like adaptability and transparency.
